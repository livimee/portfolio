		<p><b><i>animal crossing checklist</i></b></p>
		<p>I'm in the process of developing / improving this project over time. For now it is a text-based checklist of all the collectable items in animal crossing new-life. It calculates what percentage of items have been collected and keeps track of progress in a text file. I wrote the basic version in python, but plan to write an improved version in java and eventually make an actual GUI. I'm also interested in making a simple android version. </p>
		<p><b><i>this!</i></b></p>
		<p>I'm working on building this portfolio site to learn some web design / development skills. I'm planning to update / improve the site as I work my way through some books and online tutorials. Eventually I want to use this site to showcase other websites / projects that I work on. </p>
